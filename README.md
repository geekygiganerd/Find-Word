# Find-Word

This program is a problem from the [java-tutorial](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial) created by [@its-triple-s](https://github.com/its-triple-s).
This java program finds the total number of times a word has appeared in a text file.
This program takes a command line argument such as `texts/short.txt` indicating the text file it must read. It then takes a word as user input. The program then reads the entire text file to find the total number of occurrences of that word.

You will be prompted to enter a word to search for. The program will then output the total number of occurrences of that word in the text file.

## Example

```
